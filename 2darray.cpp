Got it! You want to sort each row of the 2D array independently while preserving the row-wise structure. Here's a C++ code that sorts each row of the matrix individually without flattening the entire matrix.

C++ Code (Row-wise Sorting of 2D Array):

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // For std::sort
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int rows, cols;

    // Input the number of rows and columns for the matrix
    cout << "Enter the number of rows: ";
    cin >> rows;
    cout << "Enter the number of columns: ";
    cin >> cols;

    // Declare a 2D array (matrix) with the given rows and columns
    int matrix[100][100]; // Assuming max size is 100x100 for simplicity

    // Input the elements of the matrix
    cout << "Enter the elements of the matrix:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            cin >> matrix[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Sort each row individually
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        sort(matrix[i], matrix[i] + cols); // Sort each row using std::sort
    }

    // Output the sorted matrix
    cout << "The row-wise sorted matrix is:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            cout << matrix[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl; // Move to the next row
    }

    return 0;
}

Explanation:

1. Input:

The program takes the number of rows and columns.

It then inputs the elements of the 2D matrix from the user.



2. Sorting:

The code uses std::sort() from the C++ Standard Library to sort each row individually. This function sorts elements in ascending order by default.

The sorting happens row-by-row, maintaining the structure of the matrix, but sorting the elements within each row.



3. Output:

The program outputs the matrix after sorting each row.




Example:

Input:

Enter the number of rows: 2
Enter the number of columns: 3
Enter the elements of the matrix:
3 2 1
6 5 4

Output:

The row-wise sorted matrix is:
1 2 3
4 5 6

This approach preserves the sequence of the rows and ensures that the elements in each row are sorted independently.*/
